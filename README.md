🌊 Flow of Transparency

Transforming government budgets into living, interactive rivers of light.
A civic-tech tool that makes economic data transparent, participatory, and beautiful.

✨ Problem

Governments publish budgets and spending reports, but they are buried in PDFs, jargon, and static dashboards.

Citizens struggle to see where their money goes.

Communities lack tools to hold spending accountable.

Transparency without accessibility isn’t true transparency.

💡 Solution

Flow of Transparency turns complex financial data into a flow-based, interactive visualization:

Budgets appear as streams of light branching into departments and projects.

Users can trace funds from national budgets all the way to local schools, hospitals, and roads.

Citizens can reallocate spending with sliders to create their own “dream budgets.”

Planned vs. Actual spending appears as a toggle view (translucent vs. solid flows).

Community feedback is embedded as floating orbs of comments.

Instead of static charts, the economy feels like a living system that anyone can explore.

🌀 Key Features

Flow Visualization – glowing, animated budget streams with smooth branching.

Customizable Allocations – sliders & inputs to reallocate funds dynamically.
